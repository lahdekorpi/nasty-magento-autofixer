# nasty-magento-autofixer
A nasty Magento autofixer for [magento/Magento2/#6639](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6639)

A horrible hack that pings some local paths to see that the cached version isn't empty / has the rights DOM elements.

### Absolutely do not use in production

Requires [pup](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup)
